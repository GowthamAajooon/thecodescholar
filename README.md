# DATA ANALYTICS WITH PYTHON NATIONAL WORKSHOP
Hi I attended 1-Week National Workshop on "Data Analytics With Python" from 21-26 June 2021, conducted by <b> THE CODE SCHOLAR</b>.

<br>I got to have hands on experience on:
<li>Python
<li>Maths Operations
<li>Data Massaging and Cleaning
<li>Machine Learning
<li>Visualization Techniques
<li>Project Understanding
<br><br>
During this 1-Week, everything was explained from the very basics so that
anyone with zero experience on programming can learn.
  
The instructor during the session was Mr. Nitesh. 
<br>Speakers from different industry domains, lightened up the session with their experience. 
I got to learn a lot during this 1-Week and  it was an amazing experience learning with THE CODE SCHOLAR.<br>
